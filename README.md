**Cloudtoid Interprocess** is a cross-platform shared memory queue for fast communication between processes ([Interprocess Communication or IPC][IPCWiki]). It uses a shared memory-mapped file for extremely fast and efficient communication between processes and it is used internally by Microsoft.

- [**Fast**](#performance): It is *extremely* fast.
- **Cross-platform**: It supports Windows, and Unix-based operating systems such as Linux, [macOS][macOSWiki], and [FreeBSD][FreeBSDOrg].
- [**API**](#usage): Provides a simple and intuitive API to enqueue/send and dequeue/receive messages.
- **Multiple publishers and subscribers**: It supports multiple publishers and subscribers to a shared queue.
- [**Efficient**](#performance): Sending and receiving messages is almost heap memory allocation free reducing garbage collections.
- [**Developer**](#author): Developed by a guy at Microsoft.

## NuGet Package

The NuGet package for this library is published [here][NuGet].

> Note: To improve performance, this library only supports 64-bit CLR with 64-bit processor architectures. Attempting to use this library on 32-bit processors, 32-bit operating systems, or on [WOW64][Wow64Wiki] may throw a `NotSupportedException`.

## Usage

This library supports .NET 8.0+. It is optimized for .NET dependency injection but can also be used without DI.

### Usage without DI

Creating a message queue factory:

```csharp
var factory = new QueueFactory();
```

Creating a message queue publisher:

```csharp
var options = new QueueOptions(
    queueName: "my-queue",
    capacity: 1024 * 1024);

using var publisher = factory.CreatePublisher(options);
publisher.TryEnqueue(message);
```

Creating a message queue subscriber:

```csharp
options = new QueueOptions(
    queueName: "my-queue",
    capacity: 1024 * 1024);

using var subscriber = factory.CreateSubscriber(options);
subscriber.TryDequeue(messageBuffer, cancellationToken, out var message);
```

### Usage with DI

Adding the queue factory to the DI container:

```csharp
services
    .AddInterprocessQueue() // adding the queue related components
    .AddLogging(); // optionally, we can enable logging
```

Creating a message queue publisher using an instance of `IQueueFactory` retrieved from the DI container:

```csharp
var options = new QueueOptions(
    queueName: "my-queue",
    capacity: 1024 * 1024);

using var publisher = factory.CreatePublisher(options);
publisher.TryEnqueue(message);
```

Creating a message queue subscriber using an instance of `IQueueFactory` retrieved from the DI container:

```csharp
var options = new QueueOptions(
    queueName: "my-queue",
    capacity: 1024 * 1024);

using var subscriber = factory.CreateSubscriber(options);
subscriber.TryDequeue(messageBuffer, cancellationToken, out var message);
```

## Sample

To see a sample implementation of a publisher and a subscriber process, try out the following two projects. You can run them side by side and see them in action:

- [Publisher](src/Sample/Publisher/)
- [Subscriber](src/Sample/Subscriber/)

Please note that you can start multiple publishers and subscribers sending and receiving messages to and from the same message queue.

## Performance

A lot has gone into optimizing the implementation of this library. For instance, it is mostly heap-memory allocation free, reducing the need for garbage collection induced pauses.

**Summary**: A full enqueue followed by a dequeue takes `~250 ns` on Linux, `~650 ns` on macOS, and `~300 ns` on Windows.

**Details**: To benchmark the performance and memory usage, we use [BenchmarkDotNet][BenchmarkOrg] and perform the following runs:

|                                          Method |   Description |
|------------------------------------------------ |-------------- |
|                                 Message enqueue | Benchmarks the performance of enqueuing a message. |
|                     Message enqueue and dequeue | Benchmarks the performance of sending a message to a client and receiving that message. It is inclusive of the duration to enqueue and dequeue a message. |
| Message enqueue and dequeue - no message buffer | Benchmarks the performance of sending a message to a client and receiving that message. It is inclusive of the duration to enqueue and dequeue a message and memory allocation for the received message. |

You can replicate the results by running the following command:

```posh
dotnet run Interprocess.Benchmark.csproj -c Release
```

You can also be explicit about the .NET SDK and Runtime(s) versions:

```posh
dotnet run Interprocess.Benchmark.csproj -c Release -f net7.0 --runtimes net7.0 net6.0 netcoreapp3.1
```

## Implementation Notes

This library relies on [Named Semaphores][NamedSemaphoresDoc] To signal the existence of a new message to all message subscribers and to do it across process boundaries. Named semaphores are synchronization constructs accessible across processes.

.NET Core 3.1 and .NET 6/7 do not support named semaphores on Unix-based OSs (Linux, macOS, etc.). Instead we are using P/Invoke and relying on operating system's POSIX semaphore implementation. ([Linux](src/Interprocess/Semaphore/Linux/Interop.cs) and [macOS](src/Interprocess/Semaphore/MacOS/Interop.cs) implementations).

This implementation will be replaced with [`System.Threading.Semaphore`][SemaphoreDoc] once .NET adds support for named semaphores on all platforms.

## How to Contribute

- Create a branch from `main`.
- Ensure that all tests pass on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Keep the code coverage number above 80% by adding new tests or modifying the existing tests.
- Send a pull request.
